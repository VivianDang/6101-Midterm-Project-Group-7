# Telco Customer Churn
## Description
The Telco customer churn data contains information about a telephone company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California at the end of 2017 Quarter 3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service.  
Studying such data can help companies identify the characteristics of lost customers, identify potential, soon-to-be-lost customers and develop appropriate strategies to retain them.  
The dataset is WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv.

Now all variables are significant.

```

#### Confusion matrix 
```{r confusionMatrix, results='markup'}
loadPkg("regclass")
confusion_matrix(logistic_7)
xkabledply( confusion_matrix(logistic_7), title = "Confusion matrix from Logit Model" )
unloadPkg("regclass")
```

```{r confusion matrix, results=T}
loadPkg("regclass")
cfmatrix1 = confusion_matrix(logistic_7)
accuracy1 <- (cfmatrix1[1,1]+cfmatrix1[2,2])/cfmatrix1[3,3]
precision1 <- cfmatrix1[2,2]/(cfmatrix1[2,2]+cfmatrix1[1,2])
recall1 <- cfmatrix1[2,2]/(cfmatrix1[2,2]+cfmatrix1[2,1])
specificity1 <- cfmatrix1[1,1]/(cfmatrix1[1,1]+cfmatrix1[1,2])
F1_score1 <- 2*(precision1)*(recall1)/(precision1 + recall1)
accuracy1
precision1
recall1
specificity1
F1_score1
```
From confusion matrix, we can conclude that 
Accuracy =`r accuracy1`
Precision=`r precision1`
Recall=`r recall1`
Specificity=`r specificity1`
F1 score=`r F1_score1`

```{r roc_auc, results=T}
loadPkg("pROC") 
prob=predict(logistic_7, type = "response" )
customer$prob=prob
h = roc(Churn~prob, data=customer)
auc(h) 
plot(h)
```
We have here the area-under-curve of `r auc(h)`, which is greater than 0.8. The model is considered a good fit.

```{r McFadden, results=T}
loadPkg("pscl")
ChurnLogitpr2 = pR2(logistic_7)
ChurnLogitpr2
unloadPkg("pscl") 
```
With the McFadden value of `r ChurnLogitpr2['McFadden']`, which is analogous to the coefficient of determination $R^2$, only about 27.8% of the variations in y is explained by the explanatory variables in the model.
